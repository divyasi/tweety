  <p>Tweety Bird is an Iconic cartoon character. He, like
    <a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bugs-bunny/4005-2860/" title="Bugs Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> , puts a spin on nature, as his main enemy is
    <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Sylvester">Sylvester</a> , a cat. Despite that, he defeats the cat every time. His wings, agility, and most of all his cleverness, saves him from being catfood every time. The pairing of Sylvester and Tweety
    was one of the most notable pairings. Most of the cartoons followed a standard formula:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The hungry "putty tat" wanting to eat the bird, some major obstacle stands in his way-usually
        <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Granny">Granny</a> or her bulldog Hector Tweety says "I tawt I taw a putty tat!" and "I did, I did taw a putty tat!"
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Tweety says "I tawt I taw a putty tat!" and "I did, I did taw a putty tat!"
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Sylvester spends the entire time progressively more elaborate schemes or devices to capture his meal and failing.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Origin</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    Tweety made his first appearance in 1942 in
    <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Kitties">"A Tale Of Two Kitties"</a>, directed by
    <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Clampett">Bob Clampett</a>, but was not paired with Sylvester The Cat until five years later. The 1947 cartoon
    <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Tweetie_Pie">"Tweetie Pie"</a> pitted them against each other for the first time. <br>The cartoon, which won an
    <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Academy_Award">Academy Award</a>, was the start of many short cartoons to come.
  </p>
  <h3>Design</h3>
  <p>
    In "A Tale of Two Kitties", Tweety's speech is strange, as he mispronounces many words, such as "pussy cat" (which he says as "puddy tat"). Tweety's name was originally Orson, but this was soon changed, as his current name was already presented in his
    second cartoon,
    <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Birdy_and_the_Beast">"Birdy and the Beast"</a> (1944). Tweety had initially been portrayed simply as a (wild) <br>birdling whose species had not yet been specified, and was shown to reside in an outdoor nest
    high in a tree. After those several portrayals, it was only till 1947 when he had<br>his first domestic role and his first human interaction in "Tweetie Pie", of which would become the most noted portrayal of the character (However even then, he would
    still be shown residing in an outdoor nest in later shorts).
  </p>
  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    He is a yellow canary that has a somewhat large head. His temper was at first short, and was often angry. His catchphrase is "I think I saw a kitten." As his character progressed, he became very calmer. Tweety appears to be an innocent little bird, sweet
    and extremely gentle character. Tweety often coming to handle
    <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Hector_the_Bulldog">Hector the Bulldog</a> or hide behind Granny to avoid the cat, but in the end he always manages to humiliate Sylvester, unless he ends up humiliating himself trying to catch Tweety, which
    in turn does nothing. Tweety, Sylvester and Hector (sometimes) lives in a birdcage located in Granny's house. Granny is overprotective of Tweety and keeps Sylvester away from her prized bird.
  </p>
  <h3>Rivalry</h3>
  <p>
    Tweety and Sylvester are always after each other, much like<a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote"> Wile E. Coyote</a> and the <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Road_Runner">Road Runner</a> and the formerly-MGM owned, now-owned
    Warner Bros. cat and mouse duo Tom and Jerry. Sylvester is constantly trying to eat Tweety, and the yellow canary, in turn, is usually avoiding him with ease. Although Sylvester has laid hands on Tweety and got Tweety in his mouth on some occasions,
    most of the time he has never succeeded in eating the canary. In <a href="http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Greedy_for_Tweety">
      Greedy for Tweety</a>, Sylvester succeeded in eating Tweety in a hospital where Sylvester, Tweety, and Hector were hospitalized and Granny was their nurse and once Granny found out that Sylvester ate Tweety, she did an x-ray on Sylvester and cut
    him open and got Tweety out. Most of the time, when Tweety is under the care of Granny, Sylvester cannot successfully outwit his opponent. Deep down Sylvester is jealous of Tweety because Granny gives him more attention.
